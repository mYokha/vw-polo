			<p>It will not have escaped your notice that each of the cars that compete with the Volkswagen Polo in our supermini Top Five scores a high star rating. This segment of the market is particularly competitive and each car that we recommend thoroughly deserves its score.</p>
			<p>Equally, none is completely flawless. And it is no different with the new Polo. This is a polished, mature-feeling, spacious supermini, and given its specification it’s competitively priced. It also rides well. If these are your priorities, the Polo is as good as, if not better than, any other small car you could buy.</p>
			<p>But if you’re seeking flair, chances are you’ll find the Volkswagen Polo a little dry. Dynamically it is composed and unflappable but offers little motive flavour.
			</p>
			<p>The Ford Fiesta is far more likely to put a smile on your face, as is the Mazda 2 or a Renault Clio. And only the Clio comes close to matching the Polo on its combination of rolling comfort and space.</p>
			<p>Similarly, the styling, which mirrors that of the latest Golf, isn’t as youthful as the Ford or Mazda (or a Seat Ibiza), but its conservative looks may pay dividends, especially when it comes to used values, in the longer term.</p>
			<p>Purchase prices seem high, especially when compared with increasingly talented Korean superminis, while equipment levels are actually quite good.</p>
			<p>The BlueMotion's headline figures are mightily impressive and a huge temptation, while all versions are reasonably frugal. The GTI is an interesting alternative to more frenetic hot hatches, even if ultimately it lacks the finesse and, therefore, fun of many rivals.</p>
			<p>Whichever Polo you choose, though, will be a safe bet – and that’s what best describes VW’s latest effort in this tough segment.</p>

					<h1>Rivals</h1>
					<div class="col-2-3">
						<h2>Ford Fiesta</h2>
						<h4> Fiestas sold in Europe are ostensibly the same as those sold in America and Asia</h4>
						<p>The astonishing success of the current generation of Ford Fiesta has been based on two convergent facts: first the sixth generation of Fiesta was good enough to lead the class from the moment of its introduction in 2008; second that introduction coincided with global economic meltdown forcing mass downsizing in the European car market.</p>
						<p>Suddenly people who’d never even considered a shopping car found themselves eye to eye with the Fiesta. And perhaps to their surprise, they liked what they saw.</p>
						<p>At its launch in 2008, this latest incarnation was as distinctive as the previous version was not. It was a genuinely handsome car, but like most modern Fords, ubiquity softened the impact of its design.</p>
						<p>It was given a nose job in 2013 as part of a number of visual tweaks, and new engines were introduced to ensure it continued to cut a dash. But while the success of the huge trapedozial grille treatment has been widely debated, the addition of the three-cylinder 1.0-litre Ecoboost engine has been roundly praised. <a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/fiesta">Read Fiesta review in full...</a></p>

						<h2>Mini Cooper</h2>
						<h4> Its various improvements make the new Mini more desirable and practical than ever before</h4>
						<p>The third-generation 'new' Mini is perhaps the most important yet. It shows a Mini/BMW future using a common platform and a new range of three-cylinder engines.</p>
						<p>Certainly, from the snug confines of the optional sport seats, it is hard to argue that the new Cooper is anything but a huge step forward. From behind its classy multi-function steering wheel - itself part of a significant rethink of the interior - the driving experience is welcomingly familiar.</p>
						<p>But there is also a newfound maturity and sense of quality that makes the car even more pleasant to be in and a good deal more rewarding to drive.</p>
						<p>The turbocharged 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol unit is one of four all-new, in-house-developed forced-induction three and four-cylinder engines for the new Mini. It is an absolute belter, serving up the sort of performance and user-friendliness its relatively conservative power output fails to convey on paper. <a href="hhttp://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mini/cooper">Read Mini review in full...</a></p>

						<h2>Mazda 2</h2>
						<h4>The Mazda 2 name dates back to 2002. This latest version showcases the firm's Skyactiv technology and 'Kodo' styling</h4>
						<p>The previous Mazda 2 probably deserved more attention than it got in the UK. The supermini segment is a tough nut to crack, but being good to drive, decently practical and very pretty really ought to be enough.</p>
						<p>But, much like being William Baldwin when Alec is available, the 2 turned out not to be the sibling people wanted. Instead, the Ford Fiesta, with the same co-developed platform and similar body, reaped all the glory, becoming Britain’s most popular car and the long-term class leader.</p>
						<p>Now there’s a new-generation 2, its transformation symbolic of Mazda’s maverick choice of direction since its partnership with Ford came to an end in 2008. Mazda makes much of this 2’s Skyactiv technology and Kodo styling, unfortunate jargon that actually signifies plenty.</p>
						<p>The Skyactiv philosophy – Mazda’s umbrella term for reducing the kerb weight and sourcing greater powertrain efficiency – has been instrumental in the new 2’s development. Mazda claims that it “aimed to shatter all notions of the class” when it came to remake the 2, which is its way of saying that the model, like many of its rivals, has been scaled up and moved upmarket. <a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mazda/2-2015">Read Mazda 2 review in full...</a></p>

						<h2>Skoda Fabia</h2>
						<h4>Of all the cars now sold by Skoda, it is the Fabia and its immediate forebears that best plot the manufacturer’s remarkable three-decade journey from nationalised crackpot to modernistic marvel.</h4>
						<p>The Favorit, a car that had been gestating in the communist industrial belly for almost a decade, may have been the butt of more than one joke in late-1980s Britain, but its front-engined, front-drive design was a technical breakthrough for the Czechs.</p>
						<p>Similarly, its rehashed replacement, the Felicia, was the first Skoda to benefit from new owner Volkswagen’s input during its development – one reason why it began to top 1990s satisfaction surveys.</p>
						<p>However, the Fabia, launched in 1999, was nothing short of revelatory. Using a platform so new that no other VW Group product had yet adopted it, the car showed not only what the new-millennium Skoda would be capable of but also the significance that its German parent was prepared to place on ensuring its progress. <a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/fabia-0">Read Fabia review in full...</a></p>

						<h2>Renault Clio</h2>
						<h4>Distinctive styling details are taken from the showstopping Renault Dezir concept car</h4>
						<p>Ever since the late 1940s, Renault’s range has featured an unbroken line of interesting small cars, of which the Clio has been one of the most successful.</p>
						<p>More than 12 million have found homes and, along the way, the Clio has found and enjoyed a youthful, vibrant image.</p>
						<p>Earlier variants of the Clio deserved that rep, too: being agile, neatly designed, compact, engineered for some dynamism and intelligently marketed.</p>
						<p>But – and Renault wasn’t alone in this – during the mid 2000s, when the Clio III arrived, some of that purity was lost. The Clio became bigger and heavier, and went searching – with honourable intent – for more refinement and class, growing up with its customers.</p>
						<p>With the extra refinement it found, however, it lost something, as did several of its peers during the past decade. Out went a bit of what Renault used to dub the ‘va-va-voom’. <a href="http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/clio">Read Clio review in full...</a></p>
